# Project Name: VYBZE

---

## Description:
VYBZE is a web application designed to curate music and imagery based on user-selected tags related to energy, situation, and mood. Users can select tags from dropdown menus corresponding to these categories, triggering a search for relevant tracks on Spotify and fetching associated images from Flickr. The application aims to provide a dynamic and immersive experience for users seeking music and visual content tailored to their desired atmosphere.

## Features:
- **Tag-Based Search:** Users can select tags from predefined categories including energy, situation, and mood to personalize their content preferences.
- **Dynamic Audio Playback:** VYBZE utilizes the Spotify API to search for and play audio tracks matching the selected tags, offering a seamless listening experience.
- **Imagery Integration:** The application fetches images from Flickr based on user-selected tags, displaying them in a slideshow to complement the music playback.
- **Modal Interaction:** Modal windows are used for tag selection and content presentation, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
