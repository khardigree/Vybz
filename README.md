## Description:
VYBZE is a web application designed to curate music and imagery based on user-selected tags related to energy, situation, and mood. Users can select tags from dropdown menus corresponding to these categories, triggering a search for relevant tracks on Spotify and fetching associated images from Flickr. The application aims to provide a dynamic and immersive experience for users seeking music and visual content tailored to their desired atmosphere.

- **Imagery Integration:** The application fetches images from Flickr based on user-selected tags, displaying them in a slideshow to complement the music playback.
